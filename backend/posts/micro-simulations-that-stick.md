# Micro-simulations That Stick

_By Tara Venkatesh_

Micro-simulations give learners instant feedback without needing a full platform build. We rely on three rules:

1. **One decision per screen.** Learners should compare two or three options, pick one, and see the outcome immediately.
2. **Branch just enough.** A single branch that shows one success and one near-miss teaches more than ten flat scenarios.
3. **Show the scoreboard.** We track "confidence points" so facilitators know where to spend live coaching time.

### Workflow we use

- Draft scenarios inside a spreadsheet so stakeholders can leave comments.
- Use a lightweight rules engine (even Google Apps Script) to host the branching logic.
- Pipe results back into the LMS as reflections, not grades.

This pattern turns boring compliance refreshers into living practice spaces. Learners can replay a scenario in 90 seconds and carry that momentum into the next sprint.
