# Coaching Skills For Hybrid Teams

_By Ravi Kulkarni_

Hybrid managers juggle three channels: async notes, lightweight check-ins, and live alignment calls. Coaching falls apart when those channels blur together, so we teach a simple rhythm called **kickoff, pulse, calibrate**.

## Kickoff

- Ask each learner to describe their stretch task in two sentences.
- Document what "better" would look like one week from now.
- Share the rituals you will use (voice note, Loom, live call) so expectations are set.

## Pulse

During the work week we trade async voice notes. Each note answers:

1. What is working?
2. What feels blocked?
3. What will you try next?

Because pulses are async, the manager can coach three teams in less than 20 minutes a day.

## Calibrate

Close the loop with a 15-minute live call. Screen-share the pulse log, highlight experiments that worked, and agree on the next sprint.

Coaching does not need to feel like another meeting. Protect the async rituals, keep the questions short, and you will see hybrid learners move faster without adding Zoom fatigue.
